### Introduction

The MIMIC profiles are intended to translate the MIMIC-IV database into FHIR. The purpose is to capture MIMIC-IV as is, creating terminology and profiles to represent all aspects of MIMIC.


A great deal of interest exists around FHIR development using real world fhir stores. MIMIC-FHIR looks to fill this need. 

### Background

The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV is a database of critical care records ~40,000 patients admitted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC).
