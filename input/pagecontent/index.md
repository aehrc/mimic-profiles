### Introduction
The MIMIC-IV Implementation Guide captures the [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/) clinical care database in FHIR. These MIMIC-IV Profiles are based on [FHIR R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html) and are heavily influenced by [US Core STU4](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU4/).

### What is MIMIC-IV?
[MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.0/) is a database of deidentified critical care records of ~300,000 patients admitted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA). MIMIC-IV is released publicly on [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/), a repository for medical research data, as a set of tabular CSV files. This real-world, deidentified, and freely available database should advance and enable a multitude of research applications. MIMIC-IV has gained traction in the community due to its transparent mechanism of data access, reasonably large sample size, and authentic capture of a real-world electronic health record database. MIMIC-IV has been utilized in over 3000 publications, exploring retrospective analyses and research application development.

Data from three in-hospital information systems together form MIMIC-IV, namely: a custom hospital wide electronic health record, an intensive care unit (ICU) specific clinical information system, and an emergency department information system ([MIMIC-IV-ED](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-ed/)). A total of five modules facilitate both individual and combined use of the data in MIMIC-IV.

### Usage of the MIMIC-IV Profiles
A great deal of interest exists around FHIR development using real world FHIR stores. The MIMIC-IV Profiles have been used as the foundation to create MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR as one of the first openly accessible real-world FHIR stores. The data is open access thanks to deidentification efforts carried out in the initial MIMIC-IV database.

The MIMIC-IV IG is an early stage implementation guide. As usage of the MIMIC-IV IG and the MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR datastore increase, the IG will be extended and refined. Future plans for the MIMIC-IV Profiles can be found on the [Roadmap] page.

### Intended Audience
The MIMIC-IV Profiles and the resulting datastore MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR are meant for use in research and development. The audience then breaks into two categories:
1. Researchers: The MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR datastore can be used to test and explore novel FHIR applications
2. Developers: The datastore can be used to test the robustness of applications to real-world data.
