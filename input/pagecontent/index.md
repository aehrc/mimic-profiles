### Introduction

The Pediatric and Neonatal Care (PNC) profiles are intended to support analytical workflows on clinical data collected during routine care. Analytical workflows include operations, research, and algorithm development. The profiles achieve this through:

1. Constraints regarding data content
2. Automatic pipelines to create analysis friendly data warehouses from a collection of compliant FHIR resources

A great deal of interest exists around FHIR for interoperable health exchange, but almost all implementations are not considering the analytical use case.
