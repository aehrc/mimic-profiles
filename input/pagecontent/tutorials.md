The MIMIC IG and MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR data can be used on any FHIR server. Two example tutorials have been built to show the implementation of MIMIC on a FHIR Server.

### HAPI FHIR Tutorial
[HAPI FHIR](https://hapifhir.io/) is one of the most commonly used open source FHIR Servers. There is extensive community support and development for HAPI FHIR. The MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR data can be deployed on a HAPI FHIR server and used in applications. A tutorial to import and query the datastore in HAPI FHIR can be found in the [mimic-fhir repository](https://github.com/kind-lab/mimic-fhir/tree/main/tutorial) 

### Pathling Tutorial
[Pathling](https://pathling.csiro.au/) is an analytics optimized FHIR Server. The additional features and queries in Pathling make it an useful tool for exploring the MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR datastore. A tutorail to import and query the datastore in Pathling can be found in the [mimic-fhir repository](https://github.com/kind-lab/mimic-fhir/tree/main/tutorial) 

### Future Work
Additionally there will be work to generate more tutorials for cloud platforms to use the MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR data. Read more in the [Roadmap] section.
